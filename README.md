In this project I've made a coktail wiki page,where you can browse for different cocktails,search and see informations about ingrediens.
For this website I used a free API, fetching data in a useEffect hook then setting the state,useContext hook for passing state to different components,implemented routes using React Router, and added search functionality by fetching data from the API.
